Challenge Guidelines
1 - The output expected from this challenge are two Projects (Backend, Frontend)
Laravel, React.js.
Take-Home Challenge FullStack 3
2 - Make sure to Dockerize both applications and create a docker-compose
environment with clear documentation on how to run the project.
3 - Any design from Dribbble can be applicable as long as it fulfills all needed criteria.
4 - Best practices of software development such as DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS
(Keep It Simple, Stupid), and SOLID (Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov
substitution, Interface segregation, Dependency inversion) should be incorporated.
5- Regarding the Data sources: all the data from the selected data sources should be
scrapped using any preferable way (scheduled commands for example) and saved
locally in the database, then the filtering of the data should be on the local data not the
live data sources data!
